\section{The Weekend}
When moving to flutter, the frontend group decided that our group was responsible for the move. 
We decided therefore to take a weekend and get as far as possible in this time. 
We had identified an issue in the old application, that was caused by the code connecting the frontend and API being auto generated by Swagger. 
This resulted in a lot of issues, and made it impossible to add on to the functionality. 
Besides our group, there were a couple of members of other teams present.
We divided in two teams, one that worked with writing the API connection, and one that examined ways to make the screens.
After the weekend, the work done on the Flutter application was presented. 
At that time, the API connection and related models were more or less done, and the way screens should be set up, and the blocs used was defined. 
Together with the PO group, we made a bunch of user stories that needed to be implemented before the application was useful. These were given to the groups, so everybody could contribute to the move to Flutter.
