\section{T11 Retrospective}
\gls{T11} held our own retrospect meeting after the SOS retrospective. 
Here we discussed how we felt the process had been for us as a team. 
There were a lot of elements the group liked from the sprint. 
We liked how keeping track of used hours made it possible to know when to stop working. 
A big problem with this sprint was the move to flutter. This made it impossible to keep the forty hour work week we had planned. 
Because we kept track with hours worked, we were able to know how many hours each person worked up to 33 hours overtime. We decided that these hours should be flextime, so the members can work less other times. 
We agreed that the overtime were necessary, but later overtime should be avoided if at all possible.
We also had some communication issues in the group, which led to some internal conflicts. We agreed that we should find alternative methods for resolving the conflicts when they became an issue. This could for example be to take a break for five minutes and find an alternative way to describe the discussion topic. 
We also identified the issue, that we had a tendency to discuss things that was not necessary to discuss. We agreed to try to be better at listening to each other, and accept that some people have more experience in certain arias. 
Other than these issues, we felt that the process had been successful, and that we worked well together.
