\section{T11 Retrospective} \label{s1Retrospective}

We, \gls{T11}, held our retrospect meeting after the \gls{SOSSprintRetrospective}. Here we discussed how the process worked for us as a team. There were many elements the group liked from the sprint. We liked how keeping track of used hours made it possible to know when to stop working. A big problem with this sprint was the move to Flutter, which made it impossible to keep the forty hour work week we had planned. Because we kept track with hours worked, we knew how many overtime hours each person had, which was up to 33 hours overtime. We decided that these hours should be flex-time, enabling members to work less in the coming weeks. 

We agreed that the overtime was necessary, but future overtime should be avoided if at all possible. We also had some communication issues in the group, which led to some internal conflicts. We agreed that we should find alternative methods for resolving the conflicts when they became an issue, which could, for example, be to take a break for five minutes and find an alternative way to describe the discussion topic. We also identified an issue in that we tended to discuss things that were not necessary to discuss. We agreed to try to be better at listening to each other, and accept that some people have more experience in certain areas. Other than these issues, we felt that the process had been successful and that we worked well together.
