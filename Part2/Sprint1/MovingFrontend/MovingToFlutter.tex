\subsection{Moving to Flutter}

There were two significant issues with moving from one framework to another, mid-semester. Firstly, implementing a new front-end blocked many user stories revolved around the current front-end. Secondly, organizing a large group of people is a challenge.  

After discussing with the front-end \gls{skillGroup}, we reached an agreement, where we, \gls{T11}, were put in charge of a task-force to create the core of the replacement application in a short timespan, as to block the other teams as little as possible. We chose to work over the weekend, as this would presumably block the other teams even less. 

In the following week, we planned for a presentation, and a workshop, where we presented our work and explained the architecture of the core. The core included models, \gls{fapi}, and rules and guidelines for \gls{ui} development. We finished the workshop with a demonstration of the implementation of a story using Flutter.  

Unfortunately, \gls{PO} had to reclaim all user stories, as they were no longer relevant, and new stories were issued. We worked closely with \gls{PO} to create these new user stories.
