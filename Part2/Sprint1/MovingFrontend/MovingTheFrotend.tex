\section{Moving The Frontend}

After we started to develop our user stories, we found serious problems with compiling the Xamarin app from Linux. To do this pepole needed to go through a lot of hoops, and a method that worked on one machine did not necessarily work on others.

We found out that one in four students in the project uses a Linux machine, and we had no reason to think that there would be fewer in the future.

To fix the problem we moved the project to another framework. After some discussion in the Frontend group, we decided to move all the Frontend of the application to Flutter. The following section describes this move, as well as the fundamentals of Flutter.
