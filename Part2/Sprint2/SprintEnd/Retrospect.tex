\section{SOS sprint retrospect}

The retrospect meeting for sprint 2 was held in the same way as in sprint 1.\\
The issues from the brainstorming that got three or more votes, were:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Keep information about the meetings to the calender(3 votes).
    \item Rules for who commits and merges \gls{PR}, and who deletes them(3 votes).
    \item More sessions where reviewer and author of a \gls{PR} sits togeather. 
    \item Meethings should me held in extention of each other, not a SOS at 10am and a sprint planning ad 1pm(5 votes).  
    \item Line length in Linter increased from 80(5 votes).    \item PO should review all screens(5 votes).
    \item A testing workshop(6 votes)
    \item At this time the Linter gives a warning when public members are not documented. We need documentation from last semester. Therefore it needs to be an error in stead of a warning(8 votes).
    \item A \gls{PR} should always include pictures of the screen made(9 votes).
    \item Make release preparation in one day, working togeather in the same room. Include beer(12 votes).
\end{itemize}

It should be noted, that item 5 had three comments downvoting it. It is not possible to downvote on dotstorming.com, which is the site used for this. This change was not accepted.\\
Many of the other changes involved small things in the practices. The biggest change was the release preparation changed from four days to one day.\\
