\section{SOS Retrospective}

We held the retrospective meeting for sprint 2 in the same way as in sprint 1. The most significant issues were:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Keep information about the meetings to the calendar
    \item Rules for who commits and merges \gls{PR}, and who deletes them
    \item More sessions where reviewer and author of a \gls{PR} sit together 
    \item Meetings should be held sequentially, not an \gls{SOSStandUp} at 10:00 and \gls{SOSSprintPlanning} at 13:00 
    \item Line length in Linter increased from 80    
    \item PO should review all screens
    \item A testing workshop
    \item At this time the Linter gives a warning when public members are not documented. We need documentation from last semester. Therefore it needs to be an error instead of a warning
    \item A \gls{PR} should always include pictures of the screen made
    \item Make release preparation in one day, working together in the same room. Include beer.
\end{enumerate}

Many of the other changes involved small things in the practices. The most significant change was the length of the release preparation, which changed from two days to one day.
