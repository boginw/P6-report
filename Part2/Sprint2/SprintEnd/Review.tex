\section{Review}

The purpose of the review activity is, to asses the current state of the application, and our achievements from this sprint. A few things were missing for the application to have the same features as the old application:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Add a new activity to week-plan
    \item Mark activity as done
    \item Add new week-plan
\end{itemize}

The Weekpanner application got new features and screens during sprint 2. In the end, the application had the following features:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Log in
    \item Log out
    \item Show weekplan 
    \item Choose citizen
    \item Choose weekplan
    \item Search for pictures
\end{itemize}

\gls{PO} had planned a meeting with the customers, but unfortunately, they canceled the meeting last second. So we did not have an opportunity to get an external review.
