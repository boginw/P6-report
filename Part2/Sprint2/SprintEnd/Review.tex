\section{Review}

The purpose of the Review activity is, to asses the current state of the application, and what was done in this sprint.\\
In the end of sprint 2 the basics of the Flutter application was mostly done.\\
A few things were missing for the application to have the same features as the old application:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Add new activity to weekplan
    \item Mark activity as done
    \item Add new weekplan
\end{itemize}

The weeklpanner application got new features and screens during sprint 2. At the end the application had the following features:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Log in
    \item Log out
    \item Show weekplan 
    \item Choose citizen
    \item Choose weekplan
    \item Search for pictures
\end{itemize}

Some of the basic features were done at this point, but a few essential features were still missing.
