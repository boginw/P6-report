\section{Support Tasks}
After the flutter core was released to the developers of \gls{G19} a number of bugs and short commings where revealed. This ofcourse where expected as the core was developed over one weekend and by a limited number of people. Therefore in the beginning of sprint 2 alot of resources from our group where put into ironing out these bugs and shortcommings, such that the developers could finish their tasks. The total list of core bugs/shortcommings during sprint 2 where:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Missing ability to send data from one screen to another.
  \item A issue with instantiating \glspl{bloc} that had dependencies
  \item Issues with the API-module after the implementation of the linter.
  \item Issue with login/logout behaviour.
  \item Missing continous intergration.
\end{itemize}
