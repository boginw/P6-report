\section{Sprint 2 Release Preperation}
The \gls{ST} scheduled the release preparation for the last two days. The objective was to finalize all open pull requests and for all developers to verify the looks and behavior of the app. This section shortly describes how we realized these objectives.

The \gls{SMT} recommended the authors of the open pull-requests to sit together with the reviewers and collaborate in order to finalize all open pull requests faster. Additionally, \gls{SMT} recommended the author and reviewer not to leave before the pull request was either accepted or canceled. This activity took up the entire first day of the release preparation.

The second day all developer teams were given some features in the app that they should verify. For each feature, the developers should ensure that the \gls{ui} is right, that the feature behaves as it should, and bug-hunt the feature. By bug-hunt, we mean try to break the feature, try un-expected actions, and see how the feature reacts.

If the developers did not find any bugs in any of the three different categories (\gls{ui}, behavior, or bugs), they would mark the feature as ready for release. For each bug the developers found, they would submit an issue on GitHub. Including the feature in the release requires resolving the above mentioned issue, which is usually done by the author of the issue at hand.
