\section{Sprint 2 Release Preperation}
The Sprint preperation was scheduled to last two days, doing those two days the objective was to finalize all open pull requests and for all developers to verify the looks and behavoiur of the app. In this section we will shortly describe how these objectives were realized.

To get all open pull requests finalized, it was decided that the author of the pull request and the reviwer(s) should sit together and collaborate, and none of them where to leave before the pull request was either accepted or canceled. This activity took up the entire first day of the release preperation.

The second day all developer teams where given a number of features in the app that they should verify. Verifying a feature includes; ensure the \gls{ui} is good, ensure the behavior of the feature is as one would expect and the last thing was to bug-hunt the feature. By bug-hunt we mean try to break the feature, try un-expected actions and see how the feature reacts. If no errors where found in either of the three different categories (\gls{ui}, behavior, bugs) the feature would be marked as ready for release. If errors where detected they would be created as bug-issues on github and the author would have to create a hotfix for the issues before the feature could get into the release.
