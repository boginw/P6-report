\section{Sprint 2 Release Preperation}
The \gls{ST} scheduled the Sprint preparation for the last two days. The objective was to finalize all open pull requests and for all developers to verify the looks and behavior of the app. This section shortly describes how we realized these objectives.

The \gls{SMT} recommended the authors of the open pull-requests to sit together with the reviewers and collaborate in order to finalize all open pull requests faster. Additionally, \gls{SMT} recommended the author and reviewer not to leave before the pull request was either accepted or canceled. This activity took up the entire first day of the release preparation.

The second day all developer teams where given a number of features in the app that they should verify. For each feature the developers should ensure that the \gls{ui} is good, that the feature behaves as it should, and bug-hunt the feature. By bug-hunt we mean try to break the feature, try un-expected actions and see how the feature reacts. If no errors where found in either of the three different categories (\gls{ui}, behavior, bugs) the feature would be marked as ready for release. If errors where detected they would be created as bug-issues on github and the author would have to create a hotfix for the issues before the feature could get into the release.
