The sprint 2 goal was primarily to get the new Flutter Weekplanner application useable and in a better state compared to the old Xamarin application. The tasks with the highest priority were the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Log in
    \item Show week-plan
    \item Navigate
    \item Search for pictograms
    \item Add new activity
    \item Update activity status
    \item Switch between citizen and guardian mode
    \item Reorganize the activity order
    \item Show details of an activity
\end{itemize}
