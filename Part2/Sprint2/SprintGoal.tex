\section{Sprint Goal}

The first activity of the sprints was supposed to be a sprint planning, but in the end of the first sprint \gls{G19} changed this because it did not make sense to deligate the work right away.\\
Therefore we held an introduction meeting, where the \gls{POT} briefly described the purpose of the sprint.\\
The sprint 2 goal was primarily to get the Flutter application useable. Besides this, there should be some improvements over the old Xamarin application.\\
The tasks with highest priority were the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Log in
    \item Show weekplan
    \item Navigate
    \item Search for pictograms
    \item Add new activity
\end{itemize}

These tasks was the ones we did not get done in sprint 1, and the last features we needed to get the Flutter application as far as the Xamarin.
Besides this, there was some high priority tasks, that introduced new functionality. These were:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Update activity status
    \item Shift between citizen and guardian mode
    \item Re-organize the activity order
    \item Show details
\end{itemize}

The last tasks that was called chores. These was small tasks like bugs or simple elements, that the \glspl{devTeam} could do if the had time.
