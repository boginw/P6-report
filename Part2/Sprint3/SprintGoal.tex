\section{Sprint Goal}

When we got to sprint 3, there were still some unfinished tasks from sprint 1 and sprint 2, which were:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Add a new activity to week-plan
    \item Mark activity as done 
    \item Add new week-plan
\end{itemize}

The highest priority tasks for sprint 3 was to finish these features.
Besides these tasks, there were some new ones, which were:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Rearrange the pictograms for a weekday
    \item Remove activities from week-plan
    \item Change font
    \item Implement guardian and citizen mode
\end{itemize}

All these tasks were added to the product backlog, so the different \glspl{devTeam} could see them, and take a task when they had time.
