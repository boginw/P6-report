\section{New Endpoint} \label{sec:webIssue9}

One of the task in sprint 3 was to implement or modify an endpoint for retriving all the weekdays of a citizen. Currently there is an endpoint for retriving all the names of the weekplans belonging to a citizen. this means that in order to get the object representation of a weekplan, it was necessary to iterate over all the names, and make a new request to the api for each name in order to get the whole weekplan object, instead of having an endpoint which can do this in a single request. 
The task in it self is rather trivial, but there are some interesting considerations to be made before implementing it. The previous Giraf project teams implemented a \gls{RESTApi} which is an \gls{API} design pattern
