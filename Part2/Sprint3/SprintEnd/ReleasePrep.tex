\section{Release preparation}

The sprint 3 release preparation worked much like sprint 2. The release was done over two days, and the all work had to be in the development branch by the end of day one. The work not included was postponed to sprint 4.

The second day, all teams sat together in the same room. The teams worked on eliminating bugs and adding tests.
