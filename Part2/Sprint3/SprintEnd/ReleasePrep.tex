\section{Release Preparation}

The sprint 3 release preparation worked much like sprint 2. Preparation of the release spanned two days, and all work had to be in the development branch by the end of day one. The work not included was postponed to sprint 4. The second day, all teams sat together in the same room where they worked on eliminating bugs and adding tests.
