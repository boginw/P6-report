\section{Review}

The \gls{ST} decided to get rid of the review meeting because they estimated that it was not necessary for the process. To help the reader in following the progress of the \gls{giraf} project, we decided to keep the review as part of our report. At the end of sprint 3, some new functionalities were added, as listed below:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Button to add activity
    \item Activity screen where the activity can be marked as done
    \item Add a new activity to week-plan
    \item Add new week-plan
    \item Move activity
\end{itemize}

At this point, the Weekplanner has all the features from the old application and some more.
