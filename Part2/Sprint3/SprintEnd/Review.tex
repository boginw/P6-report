\section{Review}
The \gls{SMT} decided to get rid of the review meeting because they estimated that it was not necessary. This section describes the state of the product at the end of sprint 3, so it is easier to follow the progress in the GIRAF work. 

In the end of Sprint 3 some new functionalities were added, listed below:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Button to add activity
    \item Activity screen where the activity can be marked as done
    \item Add new activity to weekplan
    \item Add new weekplan
    \item Move activity
\end{itemize}

This means that the Weekplanner has all the features from the old app and some further added. 

In this sprint we also did a lot of bug fixes and refactoring. After this sprint the server was more stabile and some work had been done on the Web-api.
