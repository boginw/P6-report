\section{Review}

Although sprint 4 was shorter than the others, we, \gls{G19}, implemented a substantial amount of features during this sprint, both concerning documentation and the Weekplanner application. In sprint 4, we worked harder on getting everything into the release, as this was the last release.  The new features on the Weekplanner application were:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Change to citizen/ guardian mode
    \item Timer function
    \item Remove weekplans
    \item Edit activity
    \item Upload from gallery
\end{itemize}

Most of the wiki documentation was added in this sprint, and some server work and bugfixes were made.
