\section{Review}
Although sprint 4 was short, there were added a lot of work during this sprint, both concerning documentation and the Weekplanner app. Some of the work, however, was done in sprint 3 but did not get into the release. In sprint 4 we worked harder on getting everything into the release, as this was the last release. 

The new features on the Weekplanner app was:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Change to citizen/ guardian mode
    \item Timer function
    \item Remove weekplans
    \item Edit activity
    \item Upload from gallery
\end{itemize}

Most of the wiki documentation was added in this sprint, and some server work and bug fixes were made.
