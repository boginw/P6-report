\section{T11 Retrospective}

The primary issue from the previous sprint was regarding the planning. We managed to make a better estimation of how many tasks we could manage compared to the last sprint. We attempted a more conservative approach estimating a little more time for each task than we did previously. We still did not estimate correctly, but it was more accurate than the previous sprints. It was accurate enough for us to decide not to employ new measures, but continue the same way again and see if, with time, it gets more accurate when we have more experience.

\subsection{Issues From This Sprint}

One of the things we discussed was that we did not utilize our time at supervisor meetings well enough. Some group members felt that too much time was spent on non-meeting related topics, which could be things like jokes or elaborating on technical details, which was not a significant issue, but an area where we could optimize our time efficiency.

We discussed the possibility of a more formal meeting structure, maybe even make a document describing how we prefer a meeting's procedure. Such a document could be shared with the supervisor as well, allowing the supervisor to make amendments.

\subsection{Things That Went Well}

We were satisfied with how our collaborations went we have had no internal conflicts and we contributed an appropriate amount to the \gls{giraf} project.
