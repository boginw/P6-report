\section{Work on the Wiki}
The work in sprint 4 focused a lot on documentation and making it easier for the next year students to take over the project. Most of the help was done by adding documentation to the Wiki repository, that contains all relevant information. 

\gls{T11} worked on three different documention tasks for the Wiki: describing the different repositories on Github; documenting picogram files; and describe how to test in flutter. 

The repository description was done in collaboration with \gls{POT} contains a very small introduction to all the repositories, both archived and active, so future developers can get a quick idea of the content.

The pictogram files documentation contains an explanation about where images are stored and how to handle them.

The test section contains information about test basics, different kinds of tests and useful information like mocking. This should make it easier for future students to start testing so it does not become too confusion in the beginning.
