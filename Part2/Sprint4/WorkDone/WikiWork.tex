\section{Wiki Work}
The work in sprint 4 focused a lot on documentation and making it easier for the next year students to take over the project. Most of the help was done by adding documentation to the Wiki repository, that contains all relevant information. 

\Gls{T11} worked on three different documentation tasks for the Wiki: describing the different repositories on GitHub, documenting picogram files, and describe how to test in Flutter. 

We did the repository description in collaboration with \gls{POT}, which contains a minimal introduction to all the repositories, both archived and active so that future developers can get a quick idea of the content.

The pictogram files documentation contains an explanation about where images are stored and how to handle them.

The test section contains information about test basics, different kinds of tests, and useful information like mocking, which should make it easier for future students to start testing.
