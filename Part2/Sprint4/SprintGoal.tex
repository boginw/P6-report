\section{Sprint Goals}
The focus of sprint 4 was mainly to make document the work done, and make the weekplanner app more useful. This ment enhancing performance and user experience. 

Most of the user stories from last sprint was done when sprint 4 started. There were only two user stories missing from earlier sprints
\begin{itemize}
    \item Change button used on activity screen
    \item Migrate to docker and document
\end{itemize}

Sprint 4 lasted 2 weeks, one week less then the other sprints, so a few new functionalities were planned for sprint 4. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Delete week plan
    \item Timer
    \item Mark activity as annulled
    \item Extend the mark mode
\end{itemize}

Beside from these, there were some bugs that should be fixed. 

As this was the last sprint, the project hand off was more in focus. There were added focus on documentation of the project to help the hand off, and all user stories should be done at the end of the sprint so they could get in the final version.
