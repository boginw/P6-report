The main focus of sprint 4 was to document the system, after that to make the Weekplanner app more useful, which meant enhancing performance and user experience. All except two user stories from sprint 3 were implemented, these were:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Change the button used on the activity screen
    \item Migrate to Docker and document the migration
\end{itemize}

As sprint 4 was only planned to last two weeks, which is one week less than the other sprints, fewer new functionalities were planned, alongside with some bugs, compared to previous sprints.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Delete week-plan
    \item Time Timer support
    \item Mark activity as annulled
    \item Extend the mark mode
\end{itemize}
