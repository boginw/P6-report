The different releases for the Weekplanner can be found in the branches of \cite{giraf_weekplanner}. The release branches follow the naming scheme: Year, Sprint Number, Release Number. The releases of 2019 are 2019S2R1, 2019S3R1, and 2019S4R1. After the last sprint, we fixed some minor bugs which resulted in a final release named 2019-Final.
