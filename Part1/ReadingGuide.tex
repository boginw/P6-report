The master branch in the weekplanner repository has releases for sprint 1, 2 and 3. Sprint 2 release is tagged release/2019S2R1, where sprint 3 and 4 has S3 and S4 instead of S2. These are the result of the different release preparations. The final release is tagged 2019-Final as we made some bug fixes after the sprint 4 release.
