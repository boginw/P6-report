\section{Introduction}

As a software engineer, it is essential to be able to collaborate with others. This skill is essential in both small and large development projects.

In all types of projects, there is some development process. Good teamwork requires a great process to be successful. It can be tricky to choose the right process and follow it afterward.

The problem is that the process has to fit both the type of developers, the volume of the project, the type of project and so on.

Even though there are many different process models and frameworks, the appropriate process will rarely, if ever, be the same in two different projects.

In the following chapters, we describe work done on a project called GIRAF. Sixth-semester Software students from Aalborg University run this project. Several \glspl{devTeam} work together, and coordinate to develop the product.

The main focus of the report is the development process we used, and how it evolved throughout the project.
