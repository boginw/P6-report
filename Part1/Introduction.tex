\section{Introduction}

Many software projects require several people to participate in the development process. The engineers need to be able to work together and coordinate the work between each other. This can be complicated when the project get too large, especially if the development process is not defined or simply bad.

No process fits all projects and many factors like size, types of people and the nature of the project should be considered. Even when this is taken into account, there can be aspects of the process that does not work optimally. Process models like \gls{Scrum} empathies the importance of revising and adapting the process frequently\cite{Scrum}.

This report describes work on a project called GIRAF. Software students work together and consults with costumers to develop a product. The students are divided into teams and define the work process themselves, continuing on the work from previous years. 

The main focus of this report is the development process. This is the development from we started on the project until the end of the development.
