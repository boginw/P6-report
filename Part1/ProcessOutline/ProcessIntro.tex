\chapter{Process Outline}

It was essential for us, \gls{G19}, to define a development process before starting the development. The \glspl{devTeam} needed to coordinate with each other and have a common understanding of how to collaborate. We, \gls{T11}, also made some decisions about our internal process. This section describes the starting processes which will be evaluated at each \gls{SOSSprintRetrospective}, and changed as needed. It is designed to make the collaboration between the \glspl{devTeam} run as smoothly as possible, without interfering with the \glspl{devTeam} internal processes.
