In all types of projects there is some kind of development process. Good teamwork requires a good process to be successful. It can be tricky to choose the right process and follow it afterwards. \\
The problem is that the process has to fit both the type of developers, the volume of the project, the type of project and so on. \\
Even though there is a lot of process models and frameworks, the appropriate process will rarely, if ever, be exactly the same in two different projects.\\

In the following chapters we describe work done on a project called GIRAF. This project is worked by sixth semester Software students from Aalborg University. Several \glspl{devTeam} work together, and coordinate to get the work done.\\

% Maybe rephrase the ending of this sentence. "the work done" sounds a bit funky to me
The main focus in the report is the process we used, and how is evolved throughout the project.
