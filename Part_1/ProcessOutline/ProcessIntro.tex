Before we could begin the development on the GIRAF project \gls{G19} decided how the development process should progress.
This was important because the \glspl{devTeam} needed to coordinate with each other, and have a common understanding of how things should be done.
We also made decisions internaly in our \gls{devTeam}. 
This section describes these processes.
