Before we started development on the GIRAF project, we,  \gls{G19} decided how the development process should progress.
This was important because the \glspl{devTeam} needed to coordinate with each other and have a common understanding of how things should be done.
We also made decisions internally in our \gls{devTeam}. 
This section describes the resulting processes.
