\section{Group process}

In addition to the \gls{G19} process, we have defined our own internal process. 
Our process defines which practices we intent to follow, and how we do the planning. 
The agreements either contains practices from, or build on the values of, \gls{XP}.
The agreements concerns the following topics: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Time planning 
    \item Coding practices
    \item Validating documentation
    \item 
\end{itemize}

The XP values are communication, simplicity, feedback, courage and respect. 
Concerning the time planning, several of our group members have had trouble in the past to balance the work done on the project with the work needed to follow the courses. This has meant that they have put in too many hours in the project, and therefore have had an overwhelming workload. There have also been cases where group members have not done their part. 
Because of this we decided to follow the \gls{XP} practice, sustainable pace practice. This saids that a programmer should not work more than 40 hours weeks. To do this, we have figured out how many hours the courses should take each week, including preparation. We took this amount and subtracted it from the 40 hours. This way, we know how many hours we should work on the project each week. 
In addition, we decided to do pair programming and test-driven development. 
We also decided to do refactoring when needed.
