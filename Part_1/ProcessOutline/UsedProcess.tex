\section{Group process}

In addition to the \gls{G19} process, we have defined our own internal process. 
This is based on the values and some of the practices of the \gls{XP} process model. 
The XP values are communication, simplicity, feedback, courage and respect. 
Several of our group members have had trouble in the past to balance the work done on the project with the work needed to follow the courses. This has meant that they have put in too many hours in the project, and therefore have had an overwhelming workload.
We have decided, therefore, to follow the sustainable pace practice, where a programmer should not work more than 40 hours weeks. To do this, we have figured out how many hours the courses should take each week, including preparation. We took this amount and subtracted it from the 40 hours. This way, we know how many hours we should work on the project each week. 
In addition, we decided to do pair programming and test-driven development. 
We also decided to do refactoring when needed.
