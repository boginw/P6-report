\section{Server}\label{app:state-at-handoff:server}

The server setup is containerized, using docker, as much as possible. Last year they started the transition of making the containers running in a cluster. For this they used Kubernetes. At the point of handoff, only the Gitlab workers run as pots inside Kubernetes.

The Kubeneters setup is one master and three nodes. Besides that, there are three non-clustered servers. On \autoref{fig:app:state-at-handoff:server} one can see the complete overview of the servers and which services they run.

The server hosting it self is handled by the Aalborg University IT Service Department, where every server is a virtualization using vSphere.
